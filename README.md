# Non-Invasive-Poultry-Health-Management-System
This ML + IoT based system enables the detection of unhealthy chickens through real-time audio data. Neural nets are employed to identify any chickens that exhibit rales, which are gurgling sounds indicative of common respiratory illnesses in poultry.
# Introduction
Poultry farming is a critical component of the global food supply chain, providing a significant source of protein through meat and eggs. However, maintaining the health of poultry is a constant challenge due to the susceptibility of chickens to various respiratory illnesses. Early detection and treatment of these illnesses are crucial to prevent widespread outbreaks that can lead to significant economic losses and impact food security.

The Non Invasive poultry Health Management System is an innovative solution that leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to enhance poultry health management. This system is designed to detect unhealthy chickens in real-time by analyzing audio data collected from the poultry environment. The core of the system is a neural network model trained to identify rales, which are abnormal respiratory sounds indicative of common respiratory diseases in chickens.
